I understand the concept of how GitHub and collaborative programming works. 
However, I don't understand where to actually find a lot of the stuff, for example, I had to get help with making a pull request. 
I also don't understand how it works when there are multiple different forks/branches and they have to combine. What if they have conflicts with each other? How can they merge?
I feel like a lot of my problems understanding will be fixed over time with actually using GitHub and getting practice.
